# PROJECT TITLE:  HOSPITAL-DATA
## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project gives detailed documentation of Hospital Patient Data.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: 
Explore Hospital Patient data to uncover key insights such as  showing the Cost of Procedure, Outcome distribution and Readmission amongst other .
The aim is to identify the Procedure with the highest cost, clearly, and Patients with low satisfaction give insight into the age group with a possible high recovery rate. produce an interactive Power BI
dashboard highlighting these findings.

### DATA SOURCES

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves investigating and summarizing datasets to discover patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies, often before applying more complex statistical models.
EDA involves graphical and statistical techniques, helping analysts understand the data's underlying structure, spot errors, and gain insights that inform decision-making and further analysis.


## STAGE 1: WORKING WITH DATA ON MICROSOFT EXCEL
At the initial stage of the project, we downloaded the file from Kaggle 
then we went ahead with Data Cleaning, Removing Duplicates value
  - Data cleaning i.e removing Duplicate values - Using this operation in Excel, 40079 duplicate values were removed and 9921 Unique values remained
  - I also calculated TOTAL REVENUE that is Quantity * Unit sold, to determine the total amount of product sold per day

## GENERATING REPORT USING PIVOT TABLE
  Highlight or click on the desired cell within your data range
  Go to the insert Tab, Click on the pivot  table button to open a dialog box
  Select Data Range, Choose where to place the pivot table (a new worksheet or in the existing worksheet)
  Build customize and format the table
